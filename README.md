# 🎲 Dice Game

A fast and fun two‑player dice battle.  
Roll the dice, score points, and race to 10 wins to claim the trophy.

## 🧠 Overview

Dice Game is a simple front‑end project built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
Two players roll their dice simultaneously.  
The higher roll wins the round, earns a point, and adds a 🎲 to their win streak.

The first player to reach **10 wins** becomes the champion, and the game displays the final total points and a trophy.
